These are the guidelines for submitting homework for CS 141. 

## Format

* All homework must be submitted electronically in pdf format and generated from an `Rmd` file;
* R code should generally follow [Hadley's R style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html);
* Theoretical problems should be written up clearly and concisely, as you would in a math course. This [guide](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/articles/how-to-write-solution) might help.

## Submission

Homework will be submitted via a Google Drive folder that is shared with the instructor and the grader. For everyone's sanity, it is important that you *follow the naming conventions* exactly. If you do not structure your homework in the following way, you will not receive credit. 

* Create a folder in Google Drive named 

```
cs_141_s2017_[mills_username]
```

(e.g. `cs_141_s2017_mpancia`);

* Share that Google Drive folder with `mpancia` and `ekager` @ `mills.edu`;
* For each homework assignment, create a folder `homework_[n]`. In this folder, you will place your submitted homework. 

  * The main PDF should be named 

```
homework_[n]_[mills_username].pdf
```

(e.g. `homework_1_mpancia.pdf`)

  * The `Rmd` file used to render the PDF should be placed in the same folder with the same naming scheme as the PDF;
  * Auxillary files should be placed in a `resources` folder within the `homework_[n]` folder;
  * **Important**: Your homework should be reproducible. Given the `Rmd` file and the contents of `resources`, the grader should be able to Knit the PDF. This means that you should use relative paths when referencing files in `resources`. 

The structure of the resulting folder should be something like:
```
├── cs_141_s2017_mpancia
    ├── homework_1
    │   ├── resources
    │   ├── homework_1_mpancia.Rmd
    │   └── homework_1_mpancia.pdf
    └── homework_2
```
