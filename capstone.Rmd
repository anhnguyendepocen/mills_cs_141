|-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overview          | Provides an understandable, high-level overview of the project. The history of the problem the project is related to and context around prior work is given. |
| Problem Statement | The problem is clearly-defined and a strategy for solving the problem is laid out.                                                                           |

### Analysis

|---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Exploratory Data Analysis | If there is a dataset associated to the problem, there is some initial exploratory data analysis included. Features and relevant statistics are calculated. If there is no data set, a description of the input space and data has been made. Abnormalities or characteristics about the data or input that need to be addressed have been identified. |
| Exploratory Visualization | A visualization has been provided that summarizes a relevant characteristic or feature to the data, with some discussion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Benchmark                 | There is a clearly-defined benchmark result or threshhold that provides a comparison of performance of solutions in the project. 

## Methodology
| Criteria           | Specification                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Preprocessing | All preprocessing steps have been clearly documented. Abnormalities or characteristics about the data or input that needed to be addressed have been corrected. If no data preprocessing is necessary, it has been clearly justified |
| Implementation     | The process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data has been thoroughly documented. Complications that occurred during the coding process are discussed.                |
| Refinement         | The process of improving upon the algorithms and techniques used is clearly documented. Both the initial and final solutions are reported, along with intermediate solutions, if necessary.                                          | 

## Results
| Criteria         | Specification                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Model Evaluation | The final model’s qualities — such as parameters — are evaluated in detail. Some type of analysis is used to validate the robustness of the model’s solution.                                                                             |
| Justification    | The final results are compared to the benchmark result or threshold with some type of statistical analysis. Justification is made as to whether the final model and solution is significant enough to have adequately solved the problem. |
